###Features
Predict survival based on passenger details:
Passenger Class (Pclass)
Sex
Age
Number of Siblings/Spouses aboard (SibSp)
Number of Parents/Children aboard (Parch)
Fare
Port of Embarkation (Embarked)
Encodes categorical features for model prediction.
Simple and interactive Streamlit interface.
